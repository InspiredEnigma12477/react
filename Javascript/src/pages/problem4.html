                shall become a bat!"

                Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of
                Wayne Enterprises. When not fighting crime, he devotes his time and immense wealth to philanthropy,
                with the help of various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred Pennyworth, his vigilante
                allies, and occasionally, his romantic interest, the former circus acrobat and current psychologist,
                Selina Kyle.

                including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin.
                Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; rather, he relies on his genius intellect,

                intimidation,
                and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his
                archenemy, the Joker.
