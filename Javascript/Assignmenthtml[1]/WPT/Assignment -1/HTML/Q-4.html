            Continental drift describes one of the earliest ways geologists thought continents moved over time. 
            ay, the theory of continental drift has been replaced by the science of plate tectonics. The theory of continental drift 
            is most associated with the scientist Alfred Wegener. In the early 20th century, Wegener published a paper explaining his 
           <!-- This is an example of comment in HTML--> theory that the continental landmasses were “drifting” across the Earth, sometimes plowing through oceans and into each other.
             He called this movement continental drift. Pangaea Wegener was convinced that all of Earth’s continents were once part of an en
             ormous, single landmass called Pangaea. Wegener, trained as an astronomer, used biology, botany, and geology describe Pangaea a
             nd continental drift. For example, fossils of the ancient reptile mesosaurus are only found in southern Africa and South America.
              Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile only one meter (3.3 feet) long, could not have swum the Atlantic Ocean. The presence of mesosaur
              us suggests a single habitat with many lakes and rivers.  <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/continental-drift-geology" target="_blank" title="Continental drift theory"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtpgi0zck/image/upload/s---nGTCNxl--/c_fit,h_580,w_860/v1/EducationHub/photos/continental-drift.jpg" width="300" height="150" align="left"></a> also studied plant
               fossils from the frigid Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, Norway. <br><br> These plants were not the hardy specimens adapted to survive in the Arctic
                climate. These fossils were of tropical plants, which are adapted to a much warmer, more humid environment. The presence of these fossils 
                suggests Svalbard once had a tropical climate. Finally, Wegener studied the stratigraphy of different rocks and mountain ranges.
                 The east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa seem to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and Wegener dis
                 covered their rock layers “fit” just as clearly. South America and Africa were not the only continents with similar geology. Wegen
                 er discovered that the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, for instance, were geologically related to the Caledoni
                 an Mountains of Scotland.<mark>Pangaea existed about 240 million years ago.</mark>By about 200 million years ago, this supercontinent began b
                 reaking up. Over millions of years, Pangaea separated into pieces that moved away from one another. These pieces slowly assumed th
                 eir positions as the continent we recognize today. Today, scientists think that several supercontinents like Pangaea have formed a
                 nd broken up over the course of the Earth’s lifespan.<br><br> These include Pannotia, which formed about 600 million years ago, and Rodini
                 a, which existed more than a billion years ago. Tectonic Activity Scientists did not accept Wegener’s theory of continental dr
                 ift. One of the elements lacking in the theory was the mechanism for how it works—why did the continents drift and what patter
                 ns did they follow? <a href="https://www.insightsonindia.com/world-geography/physical-geography-of-the-world/geomorphology/first-order/continental-drift-theory/" target="_blank" title="Continental theory blog"><img src="http://publish.illinois.edu/alfredwegener/files/2014/12/alfred-cont-4.jpg" width="300" height="150" align="right"></a> Wegener suggested 
                 that perhaps the rotation of the Earth caused the continents to shift towards and apart from each other. (It doesn't.) Today, we kno
                 w that the continents rest on massive slabs of rock called tectonic plates. The plates are always moving and interacting in a proces
                 s called plate tectonics. <mark>The continents are still moving today. Some of the most dynamic sites of tectonic activity are seafloor sp
                 reading zones and giant rift valleys. In the process of seafloor spreading, molten rock rises from within the Earth and adds new sea
                 floor (oceanic crust) to the edges of the old.</mark><br><br> Seafloor spreading is most dynamic along giant underwater mountain ranges known as mi
                 d-ocean ridges. As the seafloor grows wider, the continents on opposite sides of the ridge move away from each other. The North Ame
                 ican and Eurasian tectonic plates, for example, are separated by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The two continents are moving away from eac
                 h other at the rate of about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) per year. Rift valleys are sites where a continental landmass is ripping its
                 elf apart. Africa, for example, will eventually split along the Great Rift Valley system. What is now a single continent will emer
                 ge as two—one on the African plate and the other on the smaller <del>Somali</del> plate. The new Somali continent will be mostly oceanic, wi
                 th the Horn of Africa and Madagascar its <ins>in</ins>largest landmasses. The processes of seafloor spreading, rift valley formation, and subd
                 uction (where heavier tectonic plates sink beneath lighter ones) were not well-established until the 1960s. These processes were 
                 the main geologic forces behind what Wegener recognized as continental drift.
