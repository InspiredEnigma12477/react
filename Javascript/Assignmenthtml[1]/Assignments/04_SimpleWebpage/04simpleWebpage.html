    <h1>Keyboards</h1>
    <p id="p1">As mechanical keyboards use high-quality switches, they have an extremely long lifespan. Plus, you can get exactly the type of keyboard layout that you prefer. There are hundreds of mechanical keyboards in the market, and you can get the one that has the keyboard layout, key backlighting, colour, and material that you prefer. In case you drop something such as food or drinks on the keyboard, you can easily remove the keys and clean the keyboard. You can also buy a customized keyboard or even build your own keyboard right at home (if you have time and the right skills, of course).</p>

   <p id="p1">Mechanical keyboards have high-quality switches beneath the keys, making them extremely robust and enjoyable to type on. Since mechanical keyboards use a key switch with a spring inside, you can feel (and sometimes hear) a distinctive click. These keyboards can last for years without giving up on you. A typical mechanical keyboard’s keys can withstand up to 70 million keystrokes, which means they can last up to 10 years on average.

    In contrast, most

    that come bundled with branded PCs or laptops are <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard">membrane keyboards</a>. Membrane-based keyboards often feel mushy and they can wear down very easily. Moreover, they don’t offer a satisfying feel while you type. If you have a laptop or a branded PC, or if you purchased an affordable keyboard at a nearby store, you most probably have a membrane keyboard. Mechanical keyboard features like backlighting, programmable keys, and macros can improve your productivity by a huge margin.

    Mechanical Keys: Mechanical keys offer a satisfying typing experience when compared to membrane-based keyboards, resulting in faster typing and higher accuracy. This means that you can write more words per minute with more accuracy.
    Key Backlighting: Key backlighting offers improved visibility, especially in dim rooms or during the night, which means that you can comfortably type in the night without turning on your room light and without disturbing your partner’s sleep. You can read about various types of backlighting later in the article.
    Programmable/Macro Keys: Programmable keys (also known as Macro Keys) are additional keys that can be programmed to open anything that you like.  </p>

    <p   id="p1">For example, you can program a macro key to replicate CTRL + C and another to mimic CTRL + V. Doing this, you’ve saved two clicks and your time. Want to remove those pesky page breaks from your spreadsheets in <a class="zoom" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">Microsoft Excel</a> ? You can program a macro key to replicate ALT, T, O, A, ALT+K, SPACEBAR, ENTER with just one key. Now you’ve saved yourself seven keys! Imagine doing this dozen of times a day and thousands of times in a year. You would be saving a lot of keystrokes and a lot of time.

        Some mechanical keyboard brands offer a way to set various macro profiles, which means that a macro key could perform one function in one software and other function while using other software. For example, a macro key can be set to replicate the Copy function (CTRL + C) in a text editor, Free Transform function in Adobe Photoshop (CTRL + T), and the Clear History (CTRL + Shift + Delete) function in Google Chrome.
        
        With improved typing accuracy, better visibility in all conditions, and programmable keys to minimize the time consumed, you will definitely notice your productivity improve a lot.</p>
