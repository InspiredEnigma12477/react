        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For one, Java is arguably the most acclaimed skill and is in demand nearly everywhere. IBM, Infosys, Twitter, Netflix, Google, Spotify, Uber, Amazon, Target, Yelp, Square, and other big players are always in need of a great Java programmer. Going by PayScale.com (the website that offers information about salary), an average Java developer earns about $70,000 annually. As a pro in the field, you have the entire globe to work over, as the demand is never restricted to a particular geographical area.</p>

        <h4>Scarlett Johansson</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's free so good if your a total beginner. The content is easy to read and follow but basic.
            I do highly recommend this book if your a beginner and if you get through it ok you can pick up a more advanced paid offering.</p>

        <h4>Jamie Presly:</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It meant to be a crash course of Java but not much to learn except of confusion.
            The book seems well structured but the content and how it is explained lacks of all to be a crash course which meant to be oriented to beginners.
            Some screenshots are cut and it is printed several times in the book to 'Click here' to see links or images, but somehow the link or images are forgotten. It is a book and not an interactive screen.
            The final exercise is convoluted and you are unable to follow and recreated.
            
            Overall, it is not worth it to buy it if you want to learn Java basics and even if you have some knowledge already it may be difficult to follow up.
            Invest your money in another book</p>
