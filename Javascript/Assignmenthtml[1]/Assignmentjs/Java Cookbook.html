Java Cookbook is a collection of hundreds of practical solutions to problems <br>
that Java programmers face. The recipes range from simple tasks, such as <br>
getting your CLASSPATH right and reading information from the environment, <br>
to entire programs that demonstrate how to put XML to work or use the concurrency <br>
utilities introduced in JDK 1.5 for efficient threaded programming. Whether you <br>
plan to use the cookbook's recipes directly, as a source of ideas, or as a way to <br>
learn more about Java, Java Cookbook will become an essential part of your library. <br>
No other single book does as much to demonstrate Java's capabilities and the ease with <br>
which you can put them to use. Now in its second edition, the Java Cookbook is full of <br>
insider tips and tricks, guiding you to the latest third-party resources and providing <br>
helpful how-to's. This major revision covers JDK 1.5's many new language and API features <br>
and includes dozens of new recipes. <br>
